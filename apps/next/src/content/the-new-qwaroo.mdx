We are excited to introduce the completely revamped Qwaroo website! ðŸš€

After countless hours of hard work and dedication, we are thrilled to present to you our latest version. With this new version, we have completely rewritten Qwaroo from the ground up. New technologies, new features, and a new design. We hope you enjoy it!

## What's New?

âœ¨ A Fresh Look: Qwaroo has gotten a total makeover! Enjoy a sleek, modern design that enhances your browsing experience.

âœ¨ Enhanced Performance: We've optimized everything for speed and efficiency, ensuring a smoother and faster user experience.

âœ¨ Introducing Rating and Favourites: Express your opinion on games by liking or disliking them. You can also add games to your favourites list to keep track of them and find them easily.

## A Complete Reset

Those that may have been following us for a while may have noticed that we have reset all games and users. Not to worry, we have kept all the data and will be adding it back when appropriate. This was necessary as the old data is not compatible with the new system. If you previously had an account, log in again to ensure your data is migrated to the new system when the time comes.

## What's Next?

We have a lot of exciting things planned for the future of Qwaroo, we can't wait to share them with you! We will be posting regular updates within this blog and on [our Discord server](https://qwaroo.com/discord). Stay tuned!
