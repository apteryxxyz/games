## Introduction

The privacy of our visitors is a top priority for Apteryx Software ("we", "our", "us") and, by extension, Qwaroo ("service") and its services. The types of information that Qwaroo gathers and records, as well as how we utilise it, are detailed in this privacy policy document.

## Information Collected and Use

When you sign in to our service, you will be redirected to Discord's OAuth login system. During this process, we collect the following information from you:

- Email Address:
  We collect your email address, which will only be used for authentication purposes and will never be shared with third parties or used to send you any unsolicited emails.

- Discord User ID:
  Your Discord User ID is collected to facilitate authentication and provide you with the intended features on our platform.

- Discord Username:
  We collect your Discord username to use it as your display name on Qwaroo.

For signed in users, we will save your individual game statistics and engagement for the purpose of showcasing your performance on our platform. For guests, we do not collect any individually identifiable information. Regardless of login status, we will also record the total game plays, total scores and total time played for each game, these are used for site-wide statistics and game analysis.

Please note that we will not share, sell, or distribute any of the personal information we collect, whether it's from logged-in users or guests, without your explicit consent. We have implemented strict security measures to ensure that your personal information is protected.
